# TurtleGames: Customer Segmentation & Sales Optimisation- 98% final grade.

### Project Focus: 
In another fictional scenario my objective was investigate customer loyalty and optimise sales performance for Turtle Games,  a global gaming retailer and manufacturer.  I used a comprehensive suite of data analytics techniques with a real focus on several new skills.

### Analytical Approach Highlights:
- Customer Segmentation: Leveraging Python and R, I performed multiple linear regression (MLR), K-means clustering, and natural language processing (NLP) on Turtle Games' customer base data. This revealed factors influencing customer loyalty points and facilitated the segmentation of customers into distinct spending behaviour groups for targeted marketing strategies.
- Sales Data Exploration: A thorough analysis of sales data, visualised through R, unearthed critical insights into platform performance and sales trends. This identified which gaming platforms contributed most significantly to sales, providing a clear direction for Turtle Games to focus inventory and marketing efforts.
- Predictive Modelling for Strategic Forecasting: MLR models were built to accurately predict future sales trends based on regional sales data. This not only showcased the strong relationship between regional and global sales but also equipped Turtle Games with the tools for strategic resource allocation and sales strategy optimisation.

### Key Insights and Recommendations:
- Identified a robust predictive model with 97% accuracy, linking regional sales to global sales, underscoring the significant predictive power of NA and EU market performance on global outcomes, suggesting strategic focus areas for market investment and resource allocation.
- Addressed data challenges including heteroscedasticity and multicollinearity, emphasising the need for precise data handling, further refined data and advanced statistical techniques to refine predictive accuracy.
- Created an interactive Shiny App interface, enabling stakeholders to intuitively utilise the predictive model for strategic planning without technical expertise, enhancing decision-making efficiency.
- Highlighted the critical role of outliers in skewing sales data, necessitating sophisticated outlier management strategies to ensure model reliability and real-world applicability.
- Identified the evolving market dynamics for regions. For instance PlayStation, transitioning from a strong North American preference (41% market share for the original PlayStation compared to Europe's 31%) to a dominant position in Europe for the PSV (45% of sales in Europe and 42% for the rest of the world, compared to North America's 13%).


### Professional Development and Project Impact: 
This project served as a deep dive into the intersection of data analytics and strategic business decision-making. The wide variety of skills and tools used (Python, R, MLR, K-means clustering, and NLP) really allowed me to understand and consolidate several key areas of analysis.
